1.0,0.862,the school of athens,"""The School of Athens"" is a fresco by the Italian Renaissance artist Raphael. It was painted between 1509 and 1511 as part of a commission by Pope Julius II to decorate the rooms now known as the Stanze di Raffaello in the Apostolic Palace in Vatican City.

The painting is renowned for its accurate use of perspective and is considered one of Raphael's masterpieces, embodying the classical spirit of the Renaissance."
0.833,0.856,css flex,"CSS Flexible Box Layout, commonly known as Flexbox, is a CSS web layout model that allows responsive elements within a container to be automatically arranged depending on the viewport size. It is designed to provide a more efficient way to lay out, align, and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown or dynamic.

Key concepts of Flexbox include:

1. **Flex Container**: The parent element that holds all flex items. It is defined using the CSS `display` property set to either `flex` or `inline-flex`.
2. **Flex Item**: Any direct child element within the flex container.
3. **Axes**: Each flex container has a main axis and a cross axis. The main axis is the primary axis along which flex items are laid out, and the cross axis is perpendicular to it.
4. **Flex-direction**: Establishes the main axis direction (row, row-reverse, column, column-reverse).
5. **Justify-content**: Aligns items along the main axis (left, right, center, space-between, space-around).
6. **Align-items**: Aligns items along the cross axis.
7. **Align-content**: Aligns lines of flex items along the cross axis.
8. **Align-self**: Aligns a single item along the cross axis, overriding the `align-items` property.

Flexbox is particularly useful for creating complex layouts with ease, such as centering items both vertically and horizontally within a container. It is widely supported by modern browsers, making it a reliable choice for responsive web design.

For more detailed information, you can refer to the full article on [CSS Flexible Box Layout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout)."

0.1,0.889,the theory of relativity,"The theory of relativity, developed by Albert Einstein, consists of two main theories: special relativity and general relativity.

1. **Special Relativity**: Introduced in 1905, it deals with objects moving at constant speeds, particularly those moving close to the speed of light. It introduced the famous equation \(E = mc^2\), which shows the relationship between mass and energy. Key concepts include the relativity of simultaneity, time dilation, and length contraction.

2. **General Relativity**: Published in 1915, it extends the principles of special relativity to include gravity. It describes gravity not as a force but as a curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. This theory has been confirmed by many experiments and observations, such as the bending of light by gravity and the precise orbit of Mercury.

Both theories have had profound implications for our understanding of space, time, and the universe."

1.0,0.923,the history of the Roman Empire,"The history of the Roman Empire spans from the end of the Roman Republic in 27 BC to the fall of Constantinople in 1453 AD. It began with Augustus, the first emperor, who established the Principate. The Empire expanded significantly, reaching its zenith under Trajan. The Empire faced internal strife, economic troubles, and invasions, leading to the Crisis of the Third Century. Diocletian's reforms and the establishment of the Tetrarchy temporarily stabilized the Empire. Constantine the Great later unified the Empire and embraced Christianity. The Western Roman Empire fell in 476 AD, while the Eastern Roman Empire, known as the Byzantine Empire, continued until 1453 AD."
