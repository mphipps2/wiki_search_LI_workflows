1.0,0.856,css flex,"CSS Flexible Box Layout, commonly known as Flexbox, is a CSS web layout model that allows responsive elements within a container to be automatically arranged based on the viewport size. It enables flexible and adaptive layouts, making it easier to design web pages that look good on various screen sizes.

Key concepts of Flexbox include:
- **Flex Container**: The parent element that holds all flex items, defined using the CSS display property as either `flex` or `inline-flex`.
- **Flex Item**: Any direct child element within the flex container.
- **Main and Cross Axes**: Flexbox has two axes; the main axis is where items align, and the cross axis is perpendicular to it.
- **Flex-direction**: Determines the direction of the main axis (row, row-reverse, column, column-reverse).
- **Justify-content**: Aligns items along the main axis.
- **Align-items**: Aligns items along the cross axis.

Flexbox is widely supported in modern browsers and is particularly useful for creating responsive web designs. For more detailed information, you can visit the full article [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout)."

0.933,0.876,the theory of relativity,"The theory of relativity, developed by Albert Einstein in the early 20th century, consists of two main parts: special relativity and general relativity. 

1. **Special Relativity** (1905): This theory addresses the physics of objects moving at constant speeds, particularly those moving close to the speed of light. It introduces the concept that the laws of physics are the same for all observers, regardless of their relative motion. A key result of special relativity is the equation E=mcÂ², which expresses the equivalence of mass and energy.

2. **General Relativity** (1915): This theory extends the principles of special relativity to include acceleration and gravity. It describes gravity not as a force but as a curvature of spacetime caused by mass. Massive objects like planets and stars warp the fabric of spacetime, influencing the motion of other objects.

The theory of relativity has been confirmed through numerous experiments and observations, fundamentally changing our understanding of space, time, and gravity."

1.0,0.957,the history of the Roman Empire,"The history of the Roman Empire spans from 27 BC, marking the end of the Roman Republic, to AD 476 in the West and the fall of Constantinople in 1453 in the East. It began with Augustus, who established the Principate and initiated a period of expansion and consolidation. The empire experienced significant growth during the Julio-Claudian dynasty, followed by the Flavian and the Five Good Emperors, which were characterized by relative peace and prosperity.

However, the empire faced crises, including the Crisis of the Third Century, which led to a division into Eastern and Western Roman Empires. Diocletian's reforms attempted to stabilize the empire, but the Western Roman Empire continued to decline due to internal strife and external invasions, culminating in the abdication of Romulus Augustulus in 476.

The Eastern Roman Empire, known as the Byzantine Empire, persisted until 1453. The Roman Empire's legacy includes its contributions to law, governance, architecture, and culture, which have had a lasting impact on Western civilization.

1.0,0.975,Who discovered penicillin?,"Penicillin was discovered by Scottish physician Alexander Fleming in 1928 while he was working at St Mary's Hospital in London. He observed that a mold, later identified as Penicillium rubens, produced a substance that inhibited bacterial growth. Fleming's discovery was further developed by a team of scientists at the University of Oxford, led by Howard Florey, who worked on extracting and purifying penicillin, leading to its mass production and use in medicine. Fleming, Florey, and Ernst Chain were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1945 for their contributions to the discovery and development of penicillin."
